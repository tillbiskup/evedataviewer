Who is the target audience of the eveviewer package? Is it interesting for me?

The eveviewer package primarily addresses people working at the PTB beamlines at BESSY-II and MLS in Berlin. Furthermore, it is a data viewer tool, aimed at conveniently inspecting data directly at the beamline. To this end, basic analysis tools will increasingly be included.

However, extended data analysis is *not* the focus of this package, and the required data processing and analysis routines will be developed separately.
